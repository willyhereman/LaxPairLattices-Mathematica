Dear user, 

Instead of downloading all the files in the list, we recommend that you 
download the WinZipped (v. 8.1) file LaxPairLattices.zip, which contains

* LaxPairLattices.m: the source code in Mathematica syntax,

and various notebooks, for example, 

* demoLaxPairDifferenceEqsPotentialKdV.nb: a notebook with a demo of the 
                  program for the potential Korteweg-de Vries lattice, 
         
and various data files, for example,

* l_pKdV.m : the data file to run the lattice version of the potential 
           Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation,

as well as ALL other data files listed in the menu of the program 
(and a few extra ones).

If necessary, replace the Get command by Get["LaxPairLattices.m"].

Instructions for using the LaxPairLattices.m program should be obvious 
based on the menu system. Just execute the commands in the notebook.

You need Mathematica v. 5.0 or higher to be able to use the program.

Best wishes,
